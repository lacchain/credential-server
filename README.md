# Credential Server

This is a Credential Provider Server that can generate, sign, validate, update, and revoke credentials. The credentials follow the standard [Verifiable Credentials (VC) by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). Credentials can be used to contain information about anything. Also, they can be signed by the issuer, and refer to a subject. Therefore, if the issuer is trusted by a third party, this third party can trust information about the subject by verifying the validity of the credential, whithout having to ask the issuer. 

When the previous is leveraged, and the subject is in control of their credentials, we can build identity models that fall into the category of self-sovereign identity (SSI). LACChain is developing a techno-legal framework for SSI.

The Credential Provider Server signs a credential using its own keys, which it is configurable. It manages its own repository of credentials, which by default is a smart contract that is deployed when server inits. The Credentials are verifiable against the smart contract deployed in the blockchain by default, but you can configure and choose your proof and revocation list service.

The [Hashing Service](https://github.com/lacchain/hashing-service) and the Credential Service are being used for the notarizing tool named [LACChain Notarizer](http://notarizer.lacchain.net/), that you can use to register and verify the hash any file in the LACChain Blockchain Network for free. For any questions about the tool, you can also read the [LACChain Notarizer FAQ](https://medium.com/@lacchain.official/lacchain-notarizer-faq-6ae3dbb3441e).

## Prerequisites

* Go 1.12+ installation or later
* **GOPATH** environment variable is set correctly
* docker version 17.03 or later

## Package overview

1. **cmd/credential-provider-server** contains the main for the credential-provider-server command.
2. **lib** contains most of the code.
3. **blockchain** contains smart contracts, ABIs, connections to Ethereum
4. **business** contains business logic that will be consume by APIs
5. **models** contains data models of requests and responses of APIs
6. **swagger** contains documentation about APIs in Swagger and SwaggerUI to visualize this documentation
7. **util** contains util functions about files and ethereum address

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lacchain/credential-server

$ export GO111MODULE=on

$ cd CredentialMother/cmd/credential-provider-server
$ go build
```

## Run

```
$ credential-provider-server init [-x PASSWORD]
[PASSWORD] is your keystore password that will be created
$ credential-provider-server start --port=8000 --tlscertificate server.crt --tlskey server.key [-x PASSWORD]
```

where --port is a listen port http

You can try in localhost:8000/swagger-ui/

### Docker

* Clone this repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lacchain/credential-server
```

* Create a local directory that saves application data  

```
$ mkdir /CredentialData
```

* Copy the YAML configuration file and swaggerui from repository to your local directory created above:

```
$ cp repo/CredentialServer/credential-provider-server-config.yaml /CredentialData/
$ cp -r repo/CredentialServer/swagger/swaggerui  /CredentialData/ 

```

* Now set your parameters into the file credential-provider-server-config.yaml

* Create a directory that will store the keystore which save the private key 

```
$ mkdir -p /CredentialData/keystore
```

* After that, save your keystore into this directory 

* Finally pull the docker image and run the container, setting your node identity and the folder location that will be the volume 

```
$ docker pull ccamaleon5/credentialserver:1.0.0
$ docker run -dit -v {CredentialServer_DIR}:/CredentialProvider -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 aparejaa/credentialserver:1.0.0 credential-provider-server init [-x PASSWORD]
$ docker run -dit -v {CredentialServer_DIR}:/CredentialProvider -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 aparejaa/credentialserver:1.0.0
```

* The container will create KeyStore in your local volume

You can try in localhost:8000/swagger-ui/
